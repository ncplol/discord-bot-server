## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm
- A Discord Bot Application from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

## Development Environment Setup

This project is a monorepo containing the Node.js backend server and a React frontend client. Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd discord-bot-server
```

### 2. Configure the Backend

The backend server handles all the Discord bot logic and serves the API for the web interface.

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Create Environment File:**
    Copy the example environment file. This file will hold all your secret keys and configuration variables.
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3.  **Edit `.env` File:**
    Open the newly created `.env` file and fill in the variables. See the **Environment Variables** section below for a full description of each. You will need to get most of these from the Discord Developer Portal for your bot application.

    *   **Crucially, you must go to the "OAuth2" section of your Discord application and add a Redirect URI. It must exactly match your `DISCORD_CALLBACK_URL` (e.g., `http://localhost:3001/api/auth/discord/callback`).**

4.  **Deploy Slash Commands:**
    This only needs to be done once, or whenever you add or modify slash commands.
    ```bash
    npm run deploy-commands
    ```

### 3. Configure the Frontend

The frontend is a React application built with Vite that provides the web control panel.

1.  **Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd client
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Create Client Environment File:**
    The client needs to know the URL of the backend API.
    ```bash
    echo "VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001" > .env
    ```
    *(If you changed the `PORT` in the backend's `.env` file, make sure it matches here.)*

3.  **Return to the root directory:**
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

### 4. Run the Application

Start the backend server in development mode. It will watch for file changes and restart automatically.
```bash
# In your first terminal, from the project root:
npm run dev
```

In a second terminal, start the frontend React development server.
```bash
# In your second terminal, from the project root:
cd client
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the web interface at the URL provided by the Vite server (usually `http://localhost:5173`).
